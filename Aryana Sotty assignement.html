<h3> The Voice Generation, one of the most popular vocal schools in Russia, is organizing a concert to showcase the talent and progress of their students.</h3>

Students have worked very hard all year round. Children and adults from the vocal school will perform songs of various genres, such as pop, jazz, musical, rock and even opera. The performances will be accompanied by a live orchestra, and some numbers will include dancing and acrobatics. 

<blockquote>This year, we welcomed in our school an enormous amount of young artists, who worked really hard to achieve their dreams. We hope, that this concert will inspire even more people to pursue a musical career.
