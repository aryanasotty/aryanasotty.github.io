<p>Kaz Brekker</p>

<p>The 17-year-old indomitable leader of the Dregs and the mastermind of the heist. As a young child, Kaz lost his family when his father and his older brother died. He quickly made a name for himself as a skillful thief in the criminal underworld of Ketterdam. A thief with a gift for unlikely escapes, Kaz Brekker is a criminal prodigy who made his name on Ketterdam’s streets by turning the Dregs into a gang to be reckoned with. Cunning, quick-witted, and a born leader, he’s a planner who leaves nothing to chance. Known as Dirtyhands, he doesn’t need a reason to break a leg, sever an alliance, or change a man’s fortunes with the turn of a card.</p>

     <p>Ineg Ghafa</p>
<p>She is a member of the Dregs known as the Wraith. She works as a spy for the Dregs, gathering secrets and blackmail material from the most powerful players in the city. Her faith is deeply important to her, and her knives are named after her Saints.  Inej Ghafa was raised in a family of acrobats and performers. She was stolen from her parents and taken to Ketterdam against her will at fourteen. </p>

     <p>Jesper Fahey</p>
     <p>Jesper Fahey is a Zemeni-born sharpshooter, a member of the Dregs, and one of the protagonists of the Six of Crows duology. He is a Fabrikator who can manipulate metals, among other things, to change their texture and composition.Originally from Novyi Zem, he came to Ketterdam to study at the university . . . until he discovered the city’s gambling dens and fell into serious debt. Rarely seen without his pearl-handled revolvers, he has nearly perfect aim and thrives in high-risk situations. He is always the first to crack a joke to ease the tension—or hide his true feelings. Jesper is one of Kaz's seconds. </p>

     <p>Wylan Van Eck</p>
     <p>
He is the son of Jan Van Eck and is one of the protagonists of the Six of Crows duology. He joins the team rescuing Bo Yul-Bayur from the Ice Court because of his knowledge of demolitions and his use as a hostage in negotiating the reward.Wylan Van Eck is a runaway with a privileged past. Though no one knows what drove him to it, he fled his comfortable life among Ketterdam’s wealthiest families to take up residence in the city’s slums where he’s barely eking out an existence. Wylan would rather be playing music than building bombs, but his knowledge of chemistry makes him a valued demolitions expert. Despite his talents, he often doubts himself, and his kindness and morality make him ill-suited to life in the Barrel.</p>
